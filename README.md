# Better Bookmarks 

I need a chrome extension to organize my bookmarks better. Building your own custom tooling is fun and useful. This is why I am building this. 

The main idea:
- Bookmarks need to connect to each other. 
- Bookmarks need to be taggable.
- I want to capture meta-data about the visited page. Reading Time, Type of Content, Rating... so I can go through the bookmarks easily later.
